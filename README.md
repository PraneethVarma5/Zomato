# Zomato Clone

This repository contains a clone of the Zomato official website, created using HTML and CSS as a project to test and enhance my skills in these web development technologies.

## Overview

This project is designed to replicate the design and look of the original Zomato website. However, it has some limitations due to being built with HTML and CSS only and may not perform exactly the same as the original site.

## Features

- **HTML and CSS Only:** This project employs only HTML and CSS for the structure and styling, without any JavaScript or backend functionality.
- **Design Replication:** The layout and design closely follow that of the original Zomato website.
- **Learning Project:** The primary purpose is to test my skills and understanding of HTML and CSS.

## Limitations

- **No JavaScript:** Due to the lack of JavaScript, dynamic features found on the original Zomato website are not available.
- **Responsive Design Issues:** The site may not perfectly adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Feature Gaps:** Some advanced features available on the official Zomato website are missing.
